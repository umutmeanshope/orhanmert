# About

Orhan is a delivery note processor to read the delivery note pdf
sent by the supplier and save the data in a 2d table in Excel.

I made this program for a coworker in warehouse operations. 
So they can review and manipulate the data on the delivery note more easily.

Using regex, Orhan is tailored to the one specific format of delivery note 
sent by our supplier in Germany. Pdf format range can be expanded in the future with improvements. 

The GUI is as simple as possible to finish it faster and made using Flet library.

It was a good project to exercise data visualisation/manipulation, 
regular expressions and GUI development. More info in the files about my thought process
and the workings of the app.

More updates and improvements will be made in the future.

Feel free to suggest or make improvements on the code. I am still learning.
